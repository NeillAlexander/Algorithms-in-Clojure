h1. Algorithms in Clojure

I'm currently reading "Algorithms in Java 1-4" by Robert Sedgewick. This project contains little snippets of code I have written to help my understanding. Only I'm not writing them in Java. Oh no, that wouldn't be fun. I'm writing them in Clojure.

Be warned - there is no guarantee that this is idiomatic Clojure. I'm pretty much just translating the code from the book into Clojure.
